# CaseStudy

This project was generated using [Nx](./NX.md)

1. The steps to build and run your application
   - `yarn start`
2. The steps to execute provided tests
   - `yarn test` to run unit tests
   - `yarn e2e next-trip-e2e` to run e2e tests
     - `yarn start` should not be running since this command also does the same
3. A list of assumptions you made during development
   - Regarding _Respond reasonably to browser back and forward buttons_
     - I assumed that this meant that the user can navigate through their selections with the browser back and forward buttons
   - This application should not be deployed
